Feels like zilch. घोडी ३० वर्षांची झाली तरी लोळतीये बघा कशी गाढवासारखी. Sure, might have brought a smile ot two to a bunch of friends and family here and there, but it doesn’t justify the amount of resources of this planet that my privileged ass has consumed. And the amount of work my parents and teachers have put into making me burst with “potential”. At the same time, my nihilist, anti-natal, quarter-life crisis phase is slightly behind me, and I’ve self-declared myself wise enough to be more constructive about solving this problem.</p>

<p>Now if you’re here to tell me “You’re a human Being, not a human Doing!”, I again invite you to estimate the carbon footprint of this Being. तर, नुसतंच जगावं? का काहीतरी करावं, हा एकच सवाल आहे. A no-brainer starting point is to put something — anything — out there. Otherwise known by the nickname “output”. Although all I have is a bunch of unconnected thoughts across varied themes with no momentum to any of them. I’ve been हातावर हात ठेवून waiting for something to come out of them, and a natural starting point is to put the metaphorical pen to the metaphorical paper.</p>

<p>An article a day, keeps the anxiety at bay. Well, not everyday, but I’ll be frequently <em>outputting</em> posts here. If anyone reads them, they will serve as some signal for what I’ve been thinking about, and be an invitation to comment, collaborate, and criticize. If only I read them, they would solidify my ideas for what I want to do next. आणि ह्या ना त्या प्रकारे, म्हातारपणातील सत्काराच्या दिशेने पण काही पावलं उचलली जातील lol.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/images/origami/makalu.jpg&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;nil}</name></author><category term="meta" /><category term="30" /><category term="life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around the time I turned 30, I went through a 1/3rd-life crisis. “A third of my life is over and what have I done all these years?”.
