A Better Proposal   Set no odd-limits and no prime-limits. Choose the first P prime numbers where P is significantly large (say 8-10) and construct a P-dimensional Tonnetz net.    We will be assigning lower preferences to higher prime axes.*    Now, given the chalan of the raag, choose nodes that minimize path length (or some such metric) while traversing over the net. (*This computation is the place where.) Essentially, travelling along large-prime axes will cost us more. The further we do away from the root as well, it will incur more path cost. In the way, we can enforce a soft prime-limit and odd-limit.

Put differently, one arranges the notes &amp; ‡§ö‡§≤‡§®s of a Raag in hierarchical importance and goes down that chart to start assigning frequency values consistent with those already determined.      The 22 Shruti Theory   This theory only recognizes powers of 3 (up to the 5th power!) and powers of 5 (only 1st power!), as integers that can make up ‚Äúsimple‚Äù ratios.

A Better Proposal   Set no odd-limits and no prime-limits. Choose the first P prime numbers where P is significantly large (say 8-10) and construct a P-dimensional Tonnetz net.    We will be assigning lower preferences to higher prime axes.*    Now, given the chalan of the raag, choose nodes that minimize path length (or some such metric) while traversing over the net. (*This computation is the place where.) Essentially, travelling along large-prime axes will cost us more. The further we do away from the root as well, it will incur more path cost. In the way, we can enforce a soft prime-limit and odd-limit.
